# Spec Delta

## Purpose
Defines the application layout, mode navigation and shared UI controls that every generator mode builds on.

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Shared parameter controls
Parameter panels SHALL be composed from shared controls: numeric field with unit label, segmented choice, on/off toggle and collapsible section. Control labels SHALL never be clipped in English or Russian at the 380 px panel width.

#### Scenario: Numeric clamping
- **WHEN** the user enters a value outside a control's allowed range
- **THEN** the value is clamped to the nearest bound and the control shows the clamped value

#### Scenario: Keyboard use
- **WHEN** the user tabs through a panel
- **THEN** every control is reachable and operable from the keyboard

#### Scenario: Long labels
- **WHEN** a segmented control has labels that do not fit on one line, such as the Russian "В каждой ячейке"
- **THEN** the full label is still readable, by wrapping inside its segment or by using a shorter label
